That's why I decided to write this blog and collect little snippets of what happened after the tragedy at this Christmas time. Pieces that caught my attention and which show that at Christmas time we must not lose hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klánovice is a municipality near Prague formally part of the Prague agglomeration. It is bordered by a large forest, the Klánovice Forest. There have been murders in this forest in the past, but what happened here in December 2023 was particularly cruel and the whole country was left in shock by the act. On Friday, 15 December, a double murder with a firearm [1, 2] took place there, in which a two-month-old baby in a pram and her father died. The police failed to catch the murderer until 21 December 2023, when the same criminal shot 14 people at the Faculty of Arts of Charles University and then turned the gun on himself. It turned out that he had killed his father earlier that day. The total number of dead was thus 18 [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Czechs are used to hearing similar news about school shooters from the USA, but it was a long way off. We did not think that something similar could happen here, or we did not want to admit it. A former high school classmate of mine owns a shotgun and several other weapons. In front of his own young daughter, he showed me how to load this weapon with practice rounds.  When we get together, he often talks about how he passed his gun license test. From his narrative, I got the impression that it was something about as time and money consuming as getting a driver's license. Lots of paperwork, fees, a bit of learning, but anyone who goes through this gets a firearms license almost automatically. One of our fairly high profile politicians, who served as a European Commissioner for several years, told me how he himself was surprised that his neighbour owned a gun and boasted about this fact. We turned a blind eye as the possession of a gun licence became more and more common in our country. In the past, gun ownership was something exotic and unusual, but the more people have guns, the more gun ownership is becoming part of everyday life and the subject of normal discussion. Many people take the view that in such an environment it is better to own a gun and not be disadvantaged as a non-owner against the growing number of gun owners. Unfortunately, as the number of guns among the population grows, so does the number of misuse of guns and we are setting ourselves up for more problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally commend the act of compassion that was performed by Archbishop of Prague, Jan Graubner. He had 18 roses, the number of those who died, including the shooter, brought to the altar in St. Vitus Cathedral on 23 December on the occasion of the national mourning and mass for the victims of the shooting. He spoke these words on the occasion: "In the sacrificial procession, we will bring to the altar one rose for each victim. And we will add one for the one who allowed himself to be so manipulated by evil that he became the instrument of a horrible death. We want to express our belief that love must always triumph in the end. Amen." [5, 6]. In this eighteenth rose I see hope, hope that the agenda of the Catholic Church, which for perhaps three decades has been anti-communism, is over. An acquaintance told me that a Czech cardinal, when asked why God allows terrible atrocities to be committed, said to him: "God permits but does not forgive". Perhaps my friend twisted that somehow, but I want to believe that with Pope Francis and this rose, the age of unforgiveness in our society is ending. Perhaps the killer of the infant from the Klanovice Forest should have written on December 11, "Everyone simply hated me, hated me and will continue to hate me. I don't give a s**t because it's mutual." [7,8,9] But we Czechs, in our cathedral, the symbol of our statehood, did not behave that way. There's one among the roses for him too, what he did was totally unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also interested in the reaction of our Minister of the Interior. Anyone who thought he would call for more gun regulation would be mistaken. Instead, he has begun, quite successfully, to push an agenda of banning New Year's fireworks, the sound of which might remind some people of gun shots. But Christmas is Christmas and New Year is New Year. You don't stop or postpone their arrival even when tragedy strikes. Municipalities had purchased their fireworks long in advance, and perhaps it would not even be right to forbid people from enjoying the New Year because of the act of a madman. And so it is an interesting tidbit that several villages near Prague, including Klánovice, will not cancel their fireworks. They say it's something the locals have been looking forward to for years. So I wish for Klánovice and all Czechs that the sound of fireworks is the only shooting that will take place in our towns and villages. Perhaps our Minister of the Interior could do more in this regard than to ban fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I will describe manual disk partitioning for the instalation of Debian 12. Debian Linux is in my opinion great OS. I like it also due to the fact, that it release cycle of two years is somehow convenient for me compared to something as Ubuntu with releases each 6 months. On 10.6.2023 the &lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2023/20230610"&gt;Debian 12 Bookworm&lt;/a&gt; was released and I was about to install it on the disk. The situation somehow shifted in the recent years. Virtually every BIOS is using UEFI as a first option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me personally, MSDOS partition table with MBR is the best option when the BIOS has an option to use it. It is total disaster when you install Windows with its UEFI on the machine as it is almost impossible to install something else. I am not an expert, but in my opinion UEFI is something such as locking bootloader in your mobile phone. Noone really wants it, it causes problems but the non free software vendors love it. So the first option is to disable UEFI in bios and turn on legacy boot, create MSDOS table with one or more primary partitions and you are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;When you can not install anything&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically with Windows on your machine it is very tricky to even initiate Linux instalation even from UEFI USB disks because of this UEFI "protections" that Windows is installing. If that is your situation, try to clen CMOS and disconnect hard drive, which contains Windows. That might e.g. on some Windows preinstalled NUCs or cheap HP/Dell laptops be the only option to install Linux. Try also to prepare UEFI USB with linux using Rufus. When everything fails, you are probably not able to install Linux to your machine at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me now assume, that you at least have USB disk with &lt;a href="https://kontexty.com/posts/Debian%20ISO"&gt;https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/&lt;/a&gt; on it and it is able to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;When MSDOS partition table does not work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunatelly some bioses now do not support MSDOS tables with MBR at all. And for example my BIOS on high end motherboard had legacy support but was not able to detect and boot from M.2 SSD formatted as MBR with MSDOS partition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Forcing my BIOS to accept my decision using MSDOS table&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if you managed to install Linux but it is not booting? There is one option when you want to boot something like this and nothing is working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no other option than using UEFI disks, you still have a chance to boot your system from it. You just have to have some live USB stick with grub. On the grub screen press e, then issue ls and then issue boot (my partition), where (my partition) is the partition with the MBR bootable system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you'd like to boot UEFI enabled disk, then it is trickier but try to Google it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When you have to GPT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do manual partitioning, in Debian 12 better from Live system than from graphical installer and select GPT instead of MSDOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First partition needs to be FAT32, have boot flag and be mounted to /boot/efi.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://kontexty.com/posts/gpt-partitioning-for-uefi-in-debian-12.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
